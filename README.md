## Project Analysis
### User Profile
This website is designed for HR professionals, especially in techonology sector, who are looking for a well-rounded profile in computer engineering with programming skills and adaptability. The ideal user is a hiring employee who needs a quick overview of my skills and experience. The site is also intended for consultants or academics interested in collaboration opportunities with computer engineering students like myself.

### Information Architecture
I’ve structured the information on this page to make navigation straightforward, with sections organized to deliver a clear and efficient experience. 
Right at the top, the header provides essential contact information: my name, profile picture, phone number, email link, and LinkedIn link, so users can access the basics immediately.

Each section builds on this overview. In **About Me**, I highlight my general skills and work attitude. My **Experience** section is organized in reverse chronological order, making my latest work easily accessible. **Education** and **Certifications** provide a quick view of my academic background and skills accreditation. Finally, **Projects** and **Skills** showcase my technical competencies and practical experience, ensuring that relevant information is accessible.

To facilitate interaction, I’ve added a **"Hire Me"** button linked directly to my WhatsApp, making it easy for users to reach out quickly. Additionally, in the **Projects** section, a **"See my project"** button provides direct access to the specific project I’ve worked on, giving users an immediate example of my work.

### Visual Design
For the visual design, I wanted to make a clean and professional look, using a turquoise (#009688) and dark blue (#00796b) color palette against a white background. This color combination offers strong contrast and a polished professional feel.

I chose simple, sans-serif fonts for readability and a minimalist aesthetic. Interactive elements, like the "Hire Me" and "See my project" buttons, match the color palette to encourage engagement without overwhelming the user. Rounded elements, such as date badges and project buttons, create visual cohesion and guide the user’s eye to key information.
